# Hi I'm Cheyenne ðŸ¥°

My technical interests include:

- Machine Learning

My research interests include:
- human relationships with technology
- ethics within the field of AI
- immgration/globalization

This summer I will be interning for the **Phillipine Social Science Council** as a part of the **Freeman Fellowship Program** in Quezon City. I'll be doing front-end and back-end programming to help manage their databases and develop their website.

## Latest Project
This is a design mockup I developed for a tool that can detect deepfakes and traditional digital manipulation. This project is a part of Disinfolab, an on-campus research lab I'm a part of.

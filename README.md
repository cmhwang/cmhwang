# Hi I'm Cheyenne ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a **CS and Sociology** double major at the **College of William & Mary**. Some of my favorite courses I've taken in college include Software Development, Finite Automata, Data Structures, Gender and Global Human Rights, and Sociological Theory.

My technical interests include:
- Software Development
- Mobile App Development
- UI/UX design
- Machine Learning

My research interests include:
- human relationships with technology
- ethics within the field of AI
- immgration/globalization

For this summer, I will be interning for **Capital One** in Mclean, VA as a part of the Technology Internship program. This past summer I interned for the **Phillipine Social Science Council** as a part of the **Freeman Fellowship Program** in Quezon City. I worked on developing the front-end of their data portal website and creating data visualizations for their most popular datasets.

## Latest Project
This is an app I helped design and development with other team members for **W&M GDSC**. In addition to backend debugging, we refactored the app to have a dark theme and a cleaner user experience.
